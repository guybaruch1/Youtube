# 89-3210 Course - Youtube Project - Exercise 4
## CPP server with video recommendation, Project's Wiki

This project is a simplified version of YouTube, allowing users to watch videos as a guest or a registered user, 
so you can upload videos, write comments and see other user's profiles and their videos.

**Please note:**
1. **main** is the branch for exercise 1
2. **part_2_main** is the branch for exercise 2
3. **main_part_3** is the branch for exercise 3
4. **main_part_4** is the branch for exercise 4

**In the fourth exercise, we were asked to:**
1. Add a CPP server to the project that gives video recommendations to logged-in users, based on their watch history and users with similar taste
2. Add a Wiki folder for the project with set up explanations and using demonstrations for the whole project

### A brief explanation about this exercise's workflow:

1.	Analysing the requirements from the exerciseâ€™s pdf
2.	Putting the requirements in a [jira project](https://tomerbarak2.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/YOUT/boards/4)
3.	Dividing related tasks to each group member (for example, setting up the CPP is one part and showing the recommendations in client is another). Each group member with a feature branch of its own
4.	Merging everything and working on the main branch until the submitted version
