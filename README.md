# 89-3210 Course - Youtube Project

This project is a simplified version of YouTube, allowing users to watch videos as a guest or a registered user so you can upload, comment and like videos.

For now, this project has 2 different stand-alone applications (and it’s not yet connected to a server):
1. Web application - created using React
2. Android application – created using Android Studio
   
## A brief explanation about the workflow (for both Web and Android):

1.	Analysing the requirements from the exercise’s pdf
2.	Putting the requirements in a jira project
3.	Dividing related tasks to each group member (for example, register page and sign in page for the same group member, another one on main screen and upload videos etc). Each group member with a feature branch of its own
4.	Merging everything and working on the main branch until the submitted version
