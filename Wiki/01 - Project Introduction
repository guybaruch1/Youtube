# 89-3210 Course - Youtube Project

This project is a simplified version of YouTube,
allowing users to watch videos as a guest or a registered user, so you can upload videos, write comments, see other user's profiles and their videos
and get recommendations for videos based on similar users choices.

The project consists of the following folders:

As the name implies, this is the server folder and it consists of some sub-folders:
    The main server is a node.js server which implements the MVC model (routes, controllers, services, models, middleware)

    Theres is the uploads folder that has the uploaded videos, video's thumbnails and profile pictures
